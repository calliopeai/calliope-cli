# Changelog

## 3.0.0-alpha.1 — 2026-07-04

v3 is a deliberate reduction. The goal: a fast, predictable, maintainable
agent CLI with a small core and no lock-in — the best harness for models you
run yourself. Roughly 70% of the v2 surface was removed; everything that
stayed is tested (93%+ line coverage, 90% floor enforced).

### Removed

- **Theme packs and the cosmetic layer** — ~180 pop-culture themes
  (`@calliopelabs/cli-themes`, now archived), HUD skins, palettes, companions,
  moods, and personas. Three built-in appearances remain: `dark`, `light`,
  `no-color` (`/config set theme <name>`). One professional system prompt.
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — `/agents`, `/swarm`, `/council`,
  agent-config presets, and the `--agents` mode (preserved on branch
  `agents-orchestration-archive`; a redesigned successor will ride on fleet
  mode).
- **Niche subsystems** — embedded API server (`--serve`), terminal
  recordings, conversation branching, bookmarks, prompt templates, todos,
  profiles, background jobs, tmux integration, idle eviction, session
  timeout, and the legacy readline UI (`--legacy`).
- **Command surface** — 106 → 22 slash commands (+ flag-gated `/fleet`).
  Aliases and near-duplicates folded into subcommands: `/model list`,
  `/config set`, `/scope add|remove`, `/loop stop`, `/trust remove`.
- **Config surface** — 56 → 16 keys. Twenty flat credential keys became one
  `providers.<name>.{apiKey,baseUrl,model,region,profile}` map; smart-routing
  keys became `routing.{enabled,costSensitivity}`. v2 configs migrate
  automatically; environment-variable fallbacks are unchanged.
- **Flags** — `--batch`/`--pipe` (use `--headless`), `--configure` (use
  `--setup`), `--agents`/`--agterm`, `--serve`/`--api`, `--legacy`,
  and the never-implemented `--skip-setup`.

### Changed

- **Checkpoints unified on git.** File-snapshot checkpoints (silently broken
  under ESM since the module migration) are gone; `/restore` lists and
  restores from git-based checkpoint refs (`refs/calliope/checkpoints`).
  History is never rewritten. Non-git directories report cleanly.
- **Routers merged.** `smart-router` + `model-router` → one `router` module;
  behavior unchanged, configured via `routing.*`.
- **Sandboxes unified.** Docker and macOS Seatbelt backends behind one
  interface, routed by `sandboxMode`.
- **`/compact` compacts.** Compression is the default action; `/compact
  status` shows the summary (was inverted in v2's `/summarize`).
- **Plan approval.** `/approve` folded into the mode flow: switch to work
  mode (Shift+Tab) and reply to execute an approved plan.
- **Scuttlebot → fleet mode.** The IRC relay lives behind `fleet.enabled`
  (default off, zero cost when disabled) as `/fleet`, positioned as the
  fleet-coordination bus and audit trail. See `docs/fleet.md`.

### Fixed

- Full-coverage tests for the fleet relay internals (IRC state machine,
  SASL, reconnect), previously untested.
- Dead code removed throughout: unused file watcher, orphaned `/sandbox`
  command, unreferenced config keys, an 8-way layout switch whose branches
  rendered identically.

### Coming in 3.0.0 stable

Single-binary distribution (brew/curl, no Node required), enforced
performance budgets (cold start, keystroke latency, flat long-session
memory), and UI rendering rework. After that: local-model edit-reliability
hardening and governance primitives (replayable run logs, budget caps,
audit trail).
